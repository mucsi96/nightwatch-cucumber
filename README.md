# nightwatch-cucumber

[Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) plugin for [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/). This enables to use a BDD-style approach for cross-browser testing:
- Describe user stories in Cucumber
- Map them to HTML/DOM operations in Nightwatch.js
- Run using either local Selenium driver or cloud based WebDriver services such as SauceLabs or BrowserStack

## Installation

```
$ npm install nightwatch-cucumber
```
If you are new to Nightwatch.js you can read the [developer guide](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide).

Add the following line to Nightwatch.js configuration file.
```
globals_path: 'node_modules/nightwatch-cucumber'
```

## Demo Test
Currently feature files are located in `features` folder.

```
# features/google.feature

Feature: Google Search

Scenario: Searching Google

    Given I open Google's search page
    Then the title is "Google"
    And the Google search form exists
```

Step definitions files are located in `step-definitions` folder.

All step definitions will run with `this` set to Nightwatch.js client or browser object

```
// step-definitions/google.js

module.exports = function() {

    this.Given(/^I open Google's search page$/, function() {
        this
            .url('http://google.com')
            .waitForElementVisible('body', 1000);
    });

    this.Then(/^the title is "([^"]*)"$/, function(title) {
        this.assert.title(title);
    });

    this.Then(/^the Google search form exists$/, function() {
        this.assert.visible('input[name="q"]');
    });

};
```

## Associate Nightwatch test with feature

For nightwatch to be able to detect which feature to run, you have to associate the test with the feature. 
If the location of test files as per your nightwatch configuration is 

```
src_folders: ['temp-tests']
```

then, within the `temp-tests` folder you need to create a test file and associate it with your feature as follows

 
```javascript 
module.exports = require("nightwatch-cucumber").features["Google Search"];
```
  
## Running tests

If you have installed `nightwatch` with `-g` (global) option you can run the tests by executing
```
nightwatch
```

In other case you can run the tests by executing
```
node_modules/.bin/nightwatch
```

## Features

### Feature Tags
You can selectively run features based on tags. [More details ](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#test-tags)
```
# google.feature

@google @search
Feature: Google Search

Scenario: Searching Google

    Given I open Google's search page
    Then the title is "Google"
    And the Google search form exists
```
```
$ node nightwatch.js --tag google
```
You can also skip features based on tags
```
node nightwatch.js --skiptags google
```

### Page Objects

Add the following line to Nightwatch.js configuration file.

```
page_objects_path: 'page-objects'
```

Nightwatch reads the page objects from the folder (or folders) specified in the page_objects_path configuration property. [More details](http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#page-objects)

```
//page-objects/yahoo.js

module.exports = {
    url: 'http://yahoo.com',
    elements: {
        body: 'body',
        searchBar: 'input[name="p"]'
    }
};
```

Now we can use page objects from step definitions

```
//step-definitions/yahoo.js

module.exports = function() {

    this.Given(/^I open Yahoo's search page$/, function() {
        var yahoo = this.page.yahoo();

        yahoo
            .navigate()
            .waitForElementVisible('@body', 1000);
    });

    this.Then(/^the Yahoo search form exists$/, function() {
        var yahoo = this.page.yahoo();

        yahoo.assert.visible('@searchBar');
    });

};
```
